HOW TO INSTALL THE SPL MAJOR MODE FOR EMACS

1. Add the line

      (autoload 'spl-mode "/path/to/spl.el" nil t)

   to your .emacs file. (Make sure to change /path/to/spl.el to the
   path where spl.el actually is!) Now, you can activate spl-mode the
   obvious way, with "M-x spl-mode".

2. If you want this mode to start automatically when you visit files
   named *.spl, add this line too:

      (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.spl\\'" . spl-mode))
